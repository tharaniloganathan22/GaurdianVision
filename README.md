Developed a real-time face mask detection web app using a CNN model for classification and OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade for live face detection. Implemented a Flask-based interface for image uploads and webcam detection, with visualization using Seaborn for model evaluation. Achieved 94% accuracy in distinguishing masked and unmasked faces.
