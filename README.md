# GaurdianVision
Developed a real-time face mask detection web app using a CNN model for classification and OpenCV‚Äôs Haar Cascade for live face detection. Implemented a Flask-based interface for image uploads and webcam detection, with visualization using Seaborn for model evaluation. Achieved 94% accuracy in distinguishing masked and unmasked faces.

## üöÄ **Features**
‚úÖ **Real-time detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect faces and classify them as "Mask" or "No Mask".  
‚úÖ **Image Upload**: Users can upload images for face mask classification.  
‚úÖ **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained CNN for mask classification.  
‚úÖ **Web Interface**: Built using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
‚úÖ **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides a **classification report** and **heatmap** for model performance visualization.  
‚úÖ **Easy Deployment**: Works locally and can be deployed on **Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere**.

## üìä **Dataset**
The model is trained on the **Face Mask Detection Dataset**, which contains **images of people with and without masks**.

- **Categories**:
  - `Mask` ‚Üí Images of people wearing masks.
  - `No Mask` ‚Üí Images of people without masks.
  
- **Data Augmentation** was applied to improve model performance.

## üñº **How It Works**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Upload**
- Users upload an image via the web UI.
- The system **detects faces using OpenCV**.
- The CNN model **classifies** each detected face as **Mask** or **No Mask**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Detection (Webcam)**
- The system captures frames using OpenCV.
- It detects faces in **real-time**.
- The trained CNN model classifies the detected faces.
- The system **draws a bounding box** around the face and labels it accordingly.

## üìà **Model Training**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ CNN Architecture**
The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained using TensorFlow/Keras.  
#### **Layers:**
- **Conv2D** (Feature Extraction)
- **MaxPooling2D** (Downsampling)
- **Flatten** (Convert to 1D)
- **Dense Layers** (Classification)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics**
The model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: 94%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Loss & Accuracy Graphs**

## üìä **Performance Visualization**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix**
The confusion matrix shows how well the model differentiates between "Mask" and "No Mask."

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Report**
           precision    recall  f1-score   support

No Mask       0.94      0.94      0.94       766
   Mask       0.93      0.94      0.94       745

accuracy                           0.94      1511

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Accuracy & Loss Graphs**
- The model converged well with minimal overfitting.
- Training accuracy reached **94%**.
